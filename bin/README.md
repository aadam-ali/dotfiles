# dotfiles/scripts

An evolving collectoin of scripts written (mainly) in bash that I
utilise throughout my daily workflow. Use at your own discretion.

| Script             | Description                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [clone](./clone)   | Clone repos following a common directory pattern          |
| [coauth](./coauth) | Set coauthors to use in commit messages (only for GitHub) |
| [nb](./nb)         | My notes manager (loosely based on Zettelkasten)          |
