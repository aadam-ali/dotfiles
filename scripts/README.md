# dotfiles/scripts

A growing collection of scripts that I use as part of my daily workflow.

These scripts are by no means perfect, because they are usually written
fairly quickly. I do try to come back and tidy them up and make sure
that they do what I intend, well.

Use at your own discretion.


| Script                       | Description                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| [awsume](./awsume)           | Create tmux window that assumes an AWS role using aws-vault |
| [clone](./clone)             | Clone repos following a common directory pattern            |
| [coauth](./coauth)           | Set coauthors to use in commit messages (only for GitHub)   |
| [dot](./dot)                 | Set up and update environment configuration                 |
| [notes](./notes)             | My notes manager (loosely based on Zettelkasten)            |
| [tmux-window](./tmux-window) | Opens a repository in a new tmux window                     |
